# shonancanuck

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Sean, a former electrician turned software developer. I'm passionate about building innovative applications and solving problems with code. Here's a little about me and what I do:

## Background âš¡

I started my professional journey as an electrician, working with electrical systems and wiring. This is also where I got my introduction to programming, with PLCs. I often worked closely with technicians to essentially pair program, test and verify fire alarm systems for occupation (essentially a production environment). I also worked with network engineers to build and test complex network infrastructure and hardware. Designing, building, testing and troubleshooting was a huge part of what I did for many years in that trade. After immigrating to Japan, I was seeking a way to put these skills to work and began to explore the wider world of programming. I made the transition to software development and have been enjoying every bit of it since then.
