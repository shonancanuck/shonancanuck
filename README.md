# shonancanuck

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm shonancanuck, a former electrician turned software developer. I'm passionate about building innovative applications and solving problems with code. Here's a little about me and what I do:

## Background

I started my professional journey as an electrician, working with electrical systems and wiring. However, my fascination with technology and software led me to explore the world of programming. I made the transition to software development and have been enjoying every bit of it since then.
